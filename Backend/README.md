## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

To have a local copy of this lab up and running on your local machine, you will first need to install the following libraries and tools:

```
git
node: v14.21.3
npm: v6.14.18
```

To have a local copy of this assingnment up and running on your local machine, you will first need to install the following software:

Download Install node from node website
```
Website: https://nodejs.org/en/download
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Clone repository
```
git clone https://git.cs.dal.ca/gupta2/csci_5709_grp-04/-/tree/main/Backend?ref_type=heads
```

Change directory to app
```
cd csci_5709_grp-04
cd Backend
```
Install packages
```
npm i
```
Run Project
```
npm run dev
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:4000/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo. You may also include a quick example of what the marker should see if the installation of all required software / libraries / plug-ins was successful.



## Running the tests

If needing to run automated tests, then explain how to run the automated tests for this system. If this section is not needed, ** you may delete **.

## Deployment

To deploy on ubuntu server, follow this steps:
Clone repository
```
git clone https://git.cs.dal.ca/gupta2/csci_5709_grp-04/-/tree/main/Backend?ref_type=heads
```

Change directory to app
```
cd csci_5709_grp-04
cd Backend
```
Install packages
```
npm i
```
Build Project
```
npm 
```
This will regenerate build folder which will contains index.html.

Point `nginx` server to this location.

Your server will be up and running.
